# Docker Downloader

Docker Downloader is a convenient tool to download docker images and/or their manifest files from Docker Hub.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) will enforce a retention policy by mid 2021.
An image of a free user will be deleted if said image has not been downloaded for six months. This is outlined for example in [this blog post](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/).
However, free users can download up to 200 images in a six hour period.
Wouldn't it be great if there would be an easy tool that would simply download all the images hosted on Docker Hub?
This is exactly what this project is about: it allows you to bullk download docker images or the manifest files to overcome the retention policy.


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The project is not meant to be deployed in any production system.


### Prerequisites

Requirements for the project:
- Java JDK 11
- Maven
- Optional: IntelliJ


### Installing

- Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/mfisherman/docker-downloader.git`
- Build the project with Maven: `cd docker-downloader && mvn clean compile assembly:single`
- The .jar file is built in the `target` folder: `/target/docker-downloader-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

Optional, you can open the project using IntelliJ and run the project within IntelliJ.

### Command Line Arguments

There are a few command line arguments that are required. The most important ones are:

- `-m` or `-method` (required): there are two ways to download the images: using docker (to download the images) or pure HTTPS requests (to download the manifest files). It is recommended to use `manifest`
- `-o` or `-owner` (optional): the owner of the repositories that you want to download (e.g. mfisherman)
- `-r` or `-repositories` (optional): the repository you want to download (e.g. mfisherman/texlive). Either the `owner` or the `repositories` argument must be given
- `-a` or `-architectures` (optional): the architectures of the images you want to download (ignored when the method `manifest` is selected)
- `-t` or `-tags` (optional): the tags you want to download
- `-u` or `-username` (optional/required): if the method `manifest`is selected, you must provide the username to download the images
- `-p`or `-password` (optional/required): if the method `manifest` is selected, you must provide the password for the user to download the images
- `-s` or `-sleep` (optional): the sleep time between two downloads


### Example

The following command downloads all images (to be precise: their manifest) of the owner mfisherman using the user with the name mfisherman.

`java -jar target/docker-downloader-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  -owner=mfisherman -username=mfisherman -password=**** -method=manifest -sleep=30`
